===========================================
The Anonymous Python Application Framework
===========================================

This sections explais the choices meade for these tasks:
*Define what the threat model for APAF is and what sort of properties it should provide*


The APAF project aims to be a static file server written in python, on the same
development idea behind the tor browser bundle: being a simple and
portable executable for non-technical users. [#]_

Basic properties of the APAF are well-described by Arturo Filast√≤ on the tor-dev
mailing list. [#]_ The core model consists in a basic library which interfaces
with tor, and a basic application server.

*21:15 < rransom> What security properties should APAF provide? What attacks (or
classes of attacks) should APAF prevent or resist?*

Core Library
------------

The core library consists in a set of monkeypatches to the satndard socket
library, making it bounce queries over the current tor proxy instance.


Configuration
-------------

The application can be customized using the browser. By default the
configuration page shall be accessible only from localhost, after authenticating
with a standard login form.
The restricted access of only localhost to the configuration section shall be
unckecked.
