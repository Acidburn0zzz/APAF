===========================================
The Anonymous Python Application Framework
===========================================

This sections explais the choices meade for these tasks:
*Define what the threat model for APAF is and what sort of properties it should provide*


The APAF project aims to be a static file server written in python, on the same
development idea behind the tor browser bundle: being a simple and
portable executable for non-technical users. [#]_

Basic properties of the APAF are well-described by Arturo Filast√≤ on the tor-dev
mailing list. [#]_ The core model consists in a basic library which interfaces
with tor, and a basic application server.


Core Library
------------

The core library consists in a set of monkeypatches to the satndard socket
library, making it bounce queries over the current tor proxy instance.


Configuration
-------------

*Customizing the application and tor setup can be done wither via web interface
or a simple GUI.*

Configuring the application via web interface is probably the most elegant
and lightweight solution, even though it leads to authentication issues.
So, I see two options here:
 - Just check if the request comes from localhost, otherwise deny all
   administration pages.
 - Create a login page, using the web framework's authentication environment.

 The first one seems pretty easy with flask, but don't know wether there could
 be some security concerns. Also, coming from 127.0.0.1 will be ok, but not the
 .onion alias :S
