Features
********

**APAF** is a python library based on **twisted** and **txtorcon**. It can be
used for launching a standalone web application exposing itself via hidden
service, or as server application.

**Multiplatform**. APAF is tested on `Windows XP`, `Ubuntu 12.04` and `Mac OSX`.

**Portable**. Apart from the python package itself, APAF can be built as ``.app``,
using `py2app <http://svn.pythonmac.org/py2app/py2app/trunk/doc/index.html>`_,  and
``.exe``, using `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org>`_ for windows.

**Easy**. exposing your application with APAF is as simple as writing a class
and 3 clicks (ehi, I am still working on this). A good starting point may be
the ``staticfileserver.py`` example.


**Secure** We make sure that all APAF's outbounding connecction will pass through Tor, and
that its fingerprint is reduced to a minimum.


.. warning:: we *do not guarantee* that the application built with APAF will not
            leak data outside tor, neither the same application will make APAF
            easily recognizable.
            The developer building applications with APAF should properly audit
            the applications they are packaging to check for possible leaks.

.. seealso:: See the threat model :ref:`page <threat_model>` for further
             informations.


Installation
************

APAF can be installed using either ``pip`` or ``easy_install``.
There should be somewhere also builds for debian. ::

$ pip install git+https://github.com/globaleaks/APAF.git



Running
*******
To try out apaf, just run: ::

$ python apaf/main.py

In case you are not interested in user-experience and similar bullshits, ``--debug`` option could be helpful.
